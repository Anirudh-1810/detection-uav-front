  "analysis": "### RF Signal Analysis Report\n\n**Target ID:** SIG-CAPTURE-0042\n**Analysis Date:** 2023-10-27\n**Risk Level:** **HIGH**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Technical Analysis & Reasoning\n\nThe provided RF signature exhibits several characteristics that deviate from standard consumer UAV profiles, suggesting a specialized or potentially non-compliant platform.\n\n*   **Proximity and Power (-31.8 dBm):** The average power is significantly high. This indicates the transmitter is in very close proximity to the monitoring sensor or is transmitting with high gain. This suggests the UAV is likely within the immediate perimeter or on an approach vector.\n*   **Narrow Bandwidth (2.6 MHz):** This is a critical indicator. Standard consumer drones (DJI, Autel) typically utilize 10 MHz, 20 MHz, or 40 MHz bandwidths for high-definition video downlinks (OcuSync, Lightbridge). A 2.6 MHz bandwidth is more characteristic of:\n    *   Long-range, low-bandwidth telemetry links (e.g., Microhard, Silvus, or custom LoRa-based systems).\n    *   Industrial/Military grade C2 (Command and Control) links.\n    *   An encrypted, low-resolution \"pilot-view\" stream designed for resilience over bandwidth.\n*   **High Complexity (Spectral Entropy 0.91):** The entropy score is near-maximal, indicating a highly complex signal. This suggests the data is either heavily encrypted or utilizes sophisticated modulation (such as high-order OFDM) to maximize data throughput within a narrow band. It is not a simple analog or unmodulated carrier.\n*   **High Channel Occupancy (Active Ratio 0.82 & Persistence 0.88):** The signal is almost constantly \"on\" (82% duty cycle) and highly persistent. This is atypical for standard frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) telemetry which usually has a lower duty cycle. This indicates a continuous data stream, likely a dedicated command/control link or a persistent sensor data upload.\n\n### 2. Risk Assessment Indicators\n\n| Indicator | Value | Assessment |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Bandwidth** | 2.6 MHz | **CONCERNING**: Non-standard for consumer video; suggests specialized hardware. |\n| **Signal Power** | -31.8 dB | **CRITICAL**: Suggests immediate proximity to the sensor. |\n| **Complexity** | 0.91 Entropy | **CONCERNING**: Highly likely encrypted/proprietary modulation. |\n| **Behavior** | 0.88 Persistence | **MODERATE**: Indicates a stable, active link rather than a transient burst. |\n\n### 3. Key Observations\nThe combination of **narrow bandwidth** and **high spectral entropy** is the primary driver for the \"High\" risk rating. While consumer drones are \"loud\" and \"wide\" to support 4K video, tactical or unauthorized drones often use \"narrow and deep\" signals to maintain link stability and avoid detection. The high power level suggests this device is currently operating in a sensitive area or is making a deliberate approach.\n\n### 4. Uncertainties & Limitations\n*   **Frequency Band Missing:** Without knowing if this is in the 2.4GHz/5.8GHz ISM bands or a licensed/restricted band (e.g., 433MHz, 900MHz, or S-band), the intent remains speculative.\n*   **Directionality:** No Angle of Arrival (AoA) data is provided; we cannot determine if the signal source is moving or loitering.\n*   **Protocol Identification:** The signal does not match known WiFi-based or OcuSync signatures, which suggests it may be a custom SDR-based (Software Defined Radio) transmission or an industrial protocol (e.g., MavLink over a non-standard carrier).\n\n### 5. Recommended Actions\n1.  **Immediate Visual Confirmation:** Deploy optical sensors or security personnel to the area associated with the high signal strength.\n2.  **Frequency Scan:** Identify the center frequency to determine if the drone is operating on unauthorized or tactical frequencies.\n3.  **Active Monitoring:** Monitor for \"burst_rate\" changes; an increase in burst rate might indicate the start of a data exfiltration or high-res imagery transmission.\n4.  **Direction Finding:** If multiple sensors are available, triangulate the source to determine if the path correlates with sensitive site locations."
