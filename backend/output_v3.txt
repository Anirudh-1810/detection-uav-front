  "analysis": "Based on the RF signal capture data provided, here is the technical analysis and risk assessment.\n\n### **Risk Assessment: MODERATE**\n**Primary Rationale:** The signal exhibits characteristics of a non-standard or modified digital link. While the power levels suggest proximity, the bandwidth and persistence do not align with common consumer \"out-of-the-box\" drone protocols (like DJI OcuSync or standard WiFi), suggesting either an industrial/customized UAV or a tactical SDR-based (Software Defined Radio) communication link.\n\n---\n\n### **Technical Analysis**\n\n#### **1. Signal Strength & Proximity (`avg_power_db`: -31.8)**\n*   **Analysis:** An average power of -31.8 dBm is exceptionally high for a passive RF sensor.\n*   **Implication:** The emitter is in very close proximity to the sensor (likely within 100\u2013300 meters depending on the noise floor and antenna gain). This is not a distant \"fly-by\"; the craft is either directly overhead or loitering nearby.\n\n#### **2. Bandwidth Anomaly (`bandwidth_mhz`: 2.6)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is the most significant indicator. Standard consumer drones typically operate on 10 MHz, 20 MHz, or 40 MHz channels (WiFi or proprietary OFDM). Narrowband telemetry usually sits well below 1 MHz.\n*   **Implication:** A 2.6 MHz bandwidth is characteristic of customized digital links, often seen in **DIY (PX4/ArduPilot) systems** using specialized telemetry radios (like Microhard or Silvus) or SDRs. It is wide enough to support low-resolution video or high-refresh-rate command and control (C2) but too narrow for standard high-definition consumer video downlinks.\n\n#### **3. High Persistence & Active Ratio (`persistence_score`: 0.88, `active_ratio`: 0.82)**\n*   **Analysis:** The signal is \"on\" 82% of the time and maintains a high persistence score.\n*   **Implication:** This is not a frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) signal that is \"blinking\" across a wide band (which would show a lower active ratio on a single frequency). This is a **constant-carrier or high-duty-cycle digital stream**. This suggests a continuous data uplink/downlink, likely indicating a drone that is actively transmitting data or telemetry while loitering.\n\n#### **4. Spectral Complexity (`spectral_entropy`: 0.91)**\n*   **Analysis:** A score of 0.91 is very high, approaching white noise.\n*   **Implication:** The signal is highly complex and likely heavily encrypted or utilizes sophisticated modulation (like 64-QAM or similar). This rules out simple analog interference or basic RC toys.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Indicators & Evidence**\n*   **Proximity:** The -31.8 dB power level demands immediate attention due to the closeness of the transmitter.\n*   **Non-Standard Protocol:** The 2.6 MHz bandwidth suggests this is not a common DJI/Autel consumer product. It points toward a \"White Label,\" industrial, or military-grade tactical radio.\n*   **High Duty Cycle:** The high `active_ratio` suggests a robust data link, potentially a low-bitrate video feed or a sophisticated C2 link.\n\n### **Limitations & Uncertainties**\n*   **Frequency Missing:** The specific frequency band (e.g., 433MHz, 900MHz, 2.4GHz, 5.8GHz) was not provided. If this signal is in a licensed or restricted band (like 1.4GHz or 2.2GHz), the risk level would immediately escalate to **CRITICAL**.\n*   **Movement Data:** Without a Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDOA) or Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) history, it is impossible to determine if the drone is stationary or closing in.\n*   **Context:** This assessment assumes the sensor is in a sensitive or protected area. If this is a known testing ground, the risk is minimal.\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1.  **Immediate Visual Verification:** Given the high signal strength, the UAV is likely visible to the naked eye or thermal optics.\n2.  **Spectrum Search:** Scan for a secondary \"paired\" signal. (Drones often have one frequency for C2 and another for video; seeing only one 2.6 MHz signal might mean we are only seeing half the link).\n3.  **Direction Finding:** Prioritize localized jamming or mitigation if the signal persists within a restricted perimeter, as the high persistence suggests a loitering/surveillance mission profile."
